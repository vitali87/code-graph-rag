"""Whether a method's `self = Other()` can run before a given call (issue #2620).

The type map is method-wide: one `self = Other()` anywhere in a method types
`self` as `Other` for every call in it. A call that runs before that
assignment still runs on the instance, through its class's own member (an
alias such as `run = _own` included) and any subclass override. So a call
counts the rebinding only when the assignment can run first:

- on every path, when the assignment's statement sits in a block that also
  holds the call, earlier in it (the call runs on `Other` only);
- on some path, when it precedes the call in a branch that may not run, or
  follows it inside a loop that holds both (the call may run on either).
