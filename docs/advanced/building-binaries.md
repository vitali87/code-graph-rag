# Building Binaries

You can build a standalone binary of Code-Graph-RAG using the `build_binary.py` script. This uses PyInstaller to package the application and its dependencies into a single executable.

## Build

```bash
python build_binary.py
```

The resulting binary will be located in the `dist` directory.
